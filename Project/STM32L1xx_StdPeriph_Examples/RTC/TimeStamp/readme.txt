@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral and 
the Time Stamp feature.
By default, the Calendar Time (initialised in main.c file) is displayed on LCD
glass. 

The associated firmware performs the following:

1. It configures the RTC_AF1 pin TimeStamp to be falling edge and enables the
TimeStamp detection.

2. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the calendar is saved in 
the time-stamp registers thanks to the timestamp event detection.

To display the current Calendar time and date and the Timestamp Calendar, use the 
joystick Push buttons as follows:
  - When pressing KEY push button, the TimeStamp Calendar is cleared.
  - When pressing LEFT push button, the current RTC Calendar (Time and date) is
    displayed on the LCD GLASS.
  - When pressing RIGHT push button, the current RTC TimeStamp Calendar (Time and 
    date) is displayed on the LCD GLASS.

To select between Time and Date to be displayed on LCD GLASS.    
  - Press UP push button to display the Calendar Time (current or TimeStamp) on 
    the LCD GLASS.
  - Press DOWN push button to display the Calendar Date (current or TimeStamp) 
    on the LCD GLASS.
 
After each switch between Calendar Time and Calendar Date, LED 1 toggles.
@note  The RTC_Year member in the TimeStamp Date is always 00 (no years in the RTC_TSDR register)

      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - SEL button connected to PE.08 pin
    - Connect PC.13 to SEL buttons using a wire     
    - Joystick button UP , Down, LEFT, RIGHT, KEY Connected respectively to PE.09
      PE.10, PE.12, PE.11 and PA.00.
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.00, PD.01,PD.04 
      and PD.05 pin.
    - LCD Glass pins is shared with USART3 via jumpers, so make sure that
         Jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1<-->2.
         Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1<-->2.
    - Make Sure that The Jumper 18 (JP18) and Jumper19 (JP19) is closed.
    - Make sure that JP4 is in position 1<->2
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
