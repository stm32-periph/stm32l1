@par Example Description 

This example shows how to write/read data to/from RTC Backup data registers and 
demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

The associated firmware performs the following:

1. It configures the RTC_AF1 pin Tamper to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper 
interrupt.

2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the 
data were correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns on, otherwise LED3 turns on.

3. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the RTC backup data registers
are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. The corresponding ISR then checks
whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared. If yes, LED2 on, otherwise LED4
turns on.

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected to PD.00, PD.01, PD.04 and PD.05 pins
    - Connect PC.13 to any JoyStick buttons using a wire.
    - Make sure that JP4 is in position 1<->2
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
