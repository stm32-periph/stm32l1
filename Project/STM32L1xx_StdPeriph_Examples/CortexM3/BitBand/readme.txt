@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use CortexM3 Bit-Band access to perform atomic 
read-modify-write and read operations on a variable in SRAM.

@par Directory contents 

  - CortexM3/BitBand/stm32l1xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - CortexM3/BitBand/stm32l1xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - CortexM3/BitBand/stm32l1xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - CortexM3/BitBand/main.c              Main program
  - CortexM3/BitBand/system_stm32l1xx.c  STM32L1xx system source file
  
@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
