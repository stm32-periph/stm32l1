@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DAC to output on DAC_OUT1 sampled
values of ADC1.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC1 channel18 (PB12). The End Of 
Conversion (EOC) interrupt is enabled and the conversion is triggered by software.

The DAC channel 1 is configured with output buffer enabled.

Each time the end of conversion interrupt occurs, converted value by ADC1 is written
in DAC channel 1 register.
Thus applied voltage on ADC1 channel18 (PB12) is outputted on DAC_OUT1 (PA4).

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC1 Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3 can be used).
    @note Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position in case of using RV3.  
    - Connect PA4 (DAC_OUT1) pin to an oscilloscope.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
