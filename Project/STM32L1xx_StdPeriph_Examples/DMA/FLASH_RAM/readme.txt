@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer 
a word data buffer from FLASH memory to embedded SRAM memory.

DMA1 Channel6 is configured to transfer the contents of a 32-word data buffer
stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA1 Channel6 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA1 Channel6.
At the end of the transfer a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled. Once interrupt is generated, the remaining data to be transferred is
read which must be equal to 0. The Transfer Complete Interrupt pending bit is
then cleared. A comparison between the source and destination buffers is done to
check that all data have been correctly transferred.

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
