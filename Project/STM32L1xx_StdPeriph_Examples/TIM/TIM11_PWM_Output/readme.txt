@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM11 peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

The TIM11CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock.
SystemCoreClock is set to 32 MHz for Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
Prescaler is set to 0.
The TIM11 counter clock is running at SystemCoreClock / (prescaler + 1) = 32 MHz 
so TIM11 Frequency = TIM11 counter clock /(ARR + 1) = 32 MHz / 666 = 48 KHz

The TIM11 CCR1 register value is equal to 333, so the TIM11 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 48 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 50%:
TIM11 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM11_CCR1/ (TIM11_ARR + 1)) * 100 = 50%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - PB.09: (TIM11_CH1)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
