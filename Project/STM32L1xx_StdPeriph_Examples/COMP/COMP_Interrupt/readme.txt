@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the COMP peripheral to compare the external
voltage applied on PB12 with the Internal Voltage Reference.
And when the comparator 1 non inverting input (which is connected to PB12)
crosses (either rising or falling edges) the internal reference voltage VREFINT (1.22V),
the comparator 1 generates an interrupt and toggles LED1.

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected respectively to PD.00 pin
    - Use the potentiometer RV3
    - Before Running the example make sure that JP17 is at PB12 position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
