@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STLM75 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
STM32L152-EVAL board and used to get instantaneous external temperature
(-55°C to +125°C).
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easily monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.
The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.

By default the STM32L152-EVAL demo is setting them to (see main.c file):
  
   #define TEMPERATURE_THYS 31
   #define TEMPERATURE_TOS 32

@par Directory contents

  - I2C/I2C_TSENSOR/stm32l1xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the Jumper JP11 is fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
