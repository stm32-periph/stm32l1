@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to 
measure IDD in Run mode mode.
The Measured IDD value is displayed continuously on LCD GLASS in mA. 
The STM15L152-EVAL board is provided with an IDD measurement circuit, more
details can be provided in STM15L152-EVAL user manual.

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
    
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1<-->2
    - Make sure that jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1<-->2
    - Make sure that jumper JP4 is in IDD position (2-3)
    - Make sure that jumper JP14 is fitted
    - Make sure that jumper JP13 is in 3.3V position (2-3)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
