@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral Freeze 
and PowerDown modes.

The System is clocked by a 512kHz frequency (fsystem) (see system_stm32l1xx.c file).
Since the ADC is is clocked by a HSI (16MHz) frequency, and the sampling time is 4 
Cycles, so the ADC conversion frequency (fADCconv) is 1MHz.

The ADC is triggered by TIM2_TRGO which is connected to TIM2_Update Event.
Each time the ADC is triggered, it converts IDD Channel (which correspond to ADC 
channel5), then the ADC converts RV3 Channel (which correspond to ADC channel18).

The Freeze mode is enabled, so in spite of fADCconv is 2 times greater than fsystem, 
the ADC converts the 2 channels without erasing data. 

By enabling the Freeze mode, ADC converts the 1st selected channel (IDD Channel) and 
enters freeze mode until the data converted is read. When the data converted is read,
the ADC leaves the freeze mode and converts the 2nd selected channel (RV3 Channel).

In this case of use (fADCconv > fsystem), the freeze mode must be enabled; otherwise 
ADC will erase the data  and Overrun event will occur. When the Overrun event occurs,
the ADC stops converting until the overrun flag is cleared.

The Measured IDD and RV3 values are displayed continuously on LCD GLASS : 
  - in the Left side : the IDD measurement in mA
  - in the Right side : the RV3Voltage measurement in Volt.

The PowerDown mode is enabled and disabled through the KEY button. When the ADC 
PowerDown mode is enabled, the ADC is powered-off when it is not converting, to reduce 
Power consumption.


In this example, the ADC is powred down during 2 phases :

- Phase1: 
When ADC is in freeze mode(IDD Channel is converted but not yet read), it is not 
converting, so it is powred-off and it is powered-on again at the end of freeze (to 
convert RV3 Channel).

- Phase2:
when the ADC is waiting for a trigger event (Falling edge of TIM2 TRGO signal). In this
 case the ADC is powered up at the next trigger event.
  
@note The STM15L152-EVAL board is provided with an IDD measurement circuit, more
details can be provided in STM15L152-EVAL user manual. 

@note ADC channel18 is connected to a potentiometer (RV3) which can deliver 
a voltage between 0V and 3.3V.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
    
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - KEY button connected to PA.0 pin 
    - LCD Glass pins is shared with USART3 via jumpers, so make sure that
         Jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1-2.
         Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1-2.
    - Make sure that jumper JP4 is in IDD position (2-3).
    - Make sure that jumper JP14 is fitted.
    - Make sure that jumper JP13 is in 3.3V position (2-3).
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
     (potentiometer RV3) 
    - Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - turn RV3 on the left then on the right

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
