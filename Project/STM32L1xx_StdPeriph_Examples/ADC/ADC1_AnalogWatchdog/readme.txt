@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously  
an ADC channel.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel18. The analog watchdog
is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel18 converted value exceeds programmed analog watchdog high 
threshold (value 0xE8B) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold (value 0x26D)
an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED1 is toggled. The
LED will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which means that the 
converted value of regular ADC channel18 is outside the range limited by high and 
low analog watchdog thresholds.

@note that ADC channel18 is connected to a potentiometer (RV3) which can deliver 
a voltage between 0V and 3.3V.

Since ADC_Vref+ = 3.3V and ADC_Vref- = 0V, the low analog watchdog threshold, 
0x26D, corresponds to 0.500V (0x26D * 3.300V / 0xFFF) and the High analog watchdog 
threshold,0xE8B, corresponds to 3.000V (0xE8B * 3.300V / 0xFFF). 
The ADC1 clock is set to HSI (16MHz).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
    
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 led connected to PD.00 pin
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3) 
    - Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
