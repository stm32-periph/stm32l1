@par Project Example Template Description 

This example is used as a template that can be used as refrence to build any new 
firmware development for STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices using 
the STM32L1xx Standard Peripherals Library.


@par Directory contents 

This folder contains standard template projects for EWARM, HiTOP, MDK-ARM, RIDE
and TrueSTUDIO toolchains that compile the needed STM32L1xx Standard Peripheral's 
drivers plus all the user-modifiable files that are necessary to create a new 
project. 

  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/stm32l1xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file

  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/stm32l1xx_it.c:     Source file containing the interrupt handlers (the 
                                                             function bodies are empty in this template).

  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/stm32l1xx_it.h      Header file including all interrupt handlers prototypes.

  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/main.c              Main program
  
  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/main.h              Header file for Main program  

  - Project/STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Template/system_stm32l1xx.c  
          The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
          system and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
          To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
          provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
        
@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
